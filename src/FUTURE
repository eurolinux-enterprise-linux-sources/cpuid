Intel: Atom S1200 (Centerton) and S12x9 (Briarwood) are based on Cedarview, but
       the Intel docs provide no CPUID identification values.  And I can find
       no examples online.  Does anyone know the CPUID family/model/steppings?
Intel: I can find no cpuid information on Atom C1000, Z2000, or E2000.
       (Possibly they are (0,6),(2,7) or (0,6),(3,5)?)
AMD: Verify that (7,15,  0, 0,  1) really is steamroller.  
     And are there more specific architecture names?
AMD: Geneva (the Athlon II Neo counterpart of the Athlon II mobile Champlain, 
             or the V-Series Champlain?) 
            [not seen in any revision guides yet, though]
AMD: Revision guides haven't been updated in years.  Is AMD dead yet?

These are not really future, but I have very little data on them:
   VIA: Nano 1000/2000 (Isaiah)
   VIA: Nano 3000
